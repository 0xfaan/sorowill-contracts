//! Integration test that exercises the *compiled wasm artifact* through the
//! real `stellar` CLI against a local Soroban network, as opposed to the
//! in-process `soroban_sdk::Env::default()` unit tests in `src/test.rs`.
//!
//! This is `#[ignore]`-gated because it requires `stellar`, `docker`, and
//! network access to spin up a local standalone network, none of which are
//! available (or desirable) in the fast unit-test CI job. It is run
//! separately via `scripts/integration_test.sh` and a dedicated CI job.
//! See CONTRIBUTING.md for how to run it locally.
